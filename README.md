### Introduction

This is a Python implementation of the Preventable Risk Integrated ModEl (PRIME), an open-source non-communicable disease (NCD) scenario model that estimates the effect of population-level changes in diet, physical activity, alcohol and tobacco consumption on NCD mortality at whole-population levels.  

### New Model

A new version of the model is being constructed and will be updated here shortly.
